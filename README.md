Creating a responsive website using Bootstrap 5.

## Development Contribution

I played a significant role in crafting the front-end design and functionality of our webpage. Here's a summary of my contributions:

- **Page Creation**: I created the index and recipes page to showcase each recipe dynamically. I also implemented CSS elements to help showcase the overall design of the webpages. 

- **Dynamic Content**: Utilizing JavaScript, I implemented the dynamic display of individual recipe cards

- **Load More Option**: I introduced the "load more" feature on the index page, allowing users to effortlessly access additional content without leaving the page.

- **URL Parameters**: To exchange data, I implemented URL parameters between different pages with JavaScript.

Overall, I was mostly focused on achieving front-end tasks accompanies with the use of Javascript for exchange of information and dynamically displaying information gathered from our JSON Blob API.
