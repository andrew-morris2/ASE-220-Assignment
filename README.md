Creating a responsive website using Bootstrap 5.

Detail of project This project is for a food recipe website for food items people can create and share. When you first load up its the home page which shows our top 3 recipe choices and a new desert section as well. Along with this you have our logo with a nav bar with multiple options.
If you click on the home it brings you back to the home page. If you click on the about us it shows the details of the company and who we are. If you click on the recipes it loads up all the recipes on our page and access to click on them. And finally we had a add feature to where you can add recipes to the website.
When you click on the specific recipe you want it will pull up the single recipe with instructions on how to cook it. The stuff you need and the nutritional factors of it. Along with that there is an edit tab to where you can edit the recipe to change anything you want with ingredients how to cook or the facts.
When your back on the home page youll see the add an item in which you can click to add a new food recipe and add what you need so that people can make it and itll even save in the data
Along with that we added a delete button in which you can remove any recipe that you want and delete it from the json data as well.
Also at the bottom of the homescreen page we added a section that has baked good on it with their ingredients as well.
Also below that we added a social media section so that people can click and gain access to the social media that our “company” has and can get in touch with any of us for question.
FInally for the pagination we did it with our recipe section since it had our long list of recipes on it separating them

-Josh - I designed the detail page and created to javascript so that when one was clicked on it would pull all of the details of the one single item and detail it out. Along with tweaking some javascript on the website for functionality.

-Doug - Developed portions of scripts.js 
Implemented the functionality for adding recipes to the webpage in create.html.
Made minor adjustments to other files as needed.
